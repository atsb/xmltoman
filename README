xmltoman and xmlmantohtml are two very simple scripts for converting xml
to groff or html.

To test the examples:
xmltoman xml/masqmail.8.xml > masqmail.8
Look at the result with
man -l masqmail.8

installation:
make
make install

By default, the scripts will be installed to /usr/local. Override
this with setting PREFIX, eg.:

make PREFIX=/usr
make install PREFIX=/usr

An alternative to use xmlmantohtml is to pass the XML source through
an XSLT interpreter such das "xsltproc" (available as Debian package
under this name). A XSL template for HTML may be found in
/usr/share/xmltoman/xmltoman.xsl.

If this proves to be a usefule alternative, xmlmantohtml will
be dprecated.

Many thanks to Lennart Poettering, who provided the stylesheets
and the dtd.
